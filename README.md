# Syncra, an Open Source Application based on TopLogic Open Source

The idea for Syncra emerged in parallel with the thought of making TopLogic available as open source in the future. 
In addition to the TopLogic platform, models should also be made available as open source. 
Syncra is intended to be the first application to be available as an open-source model. 
Syncra is completely based on the modeling tools integrated into TopLogic and on TopLogic's proprietary scripting language, 
TopLogic-Script.


## Regarding the professional background, features:

The core idea was crucial: to present TopLogic as a kind of data hub for various application scenarios.
It made sense to set up a scenario here, as it often occurs in the manufacturing and development industries:
 product master data, bills of materials, issues, risk management, goal management, measure and change management, 
 supplier management, and report management. All these sub-areas work with the same data.

Syncra is a self-contained application that covers all the mentioned sub-areas. Of course, 
it is not possible from a professional perspective to capture and implement all conceivable situations. 
Also, limitations were accepted at some points due to complexity reasons. However, at least basic functionality 
is provided for all sub-areas.

A second goal pursued with the Syncra model: It should also serve as a technical demo that does not operate at an 
abstract level but instead depicts concrete application scenarios that occur repeatedly in practice.
